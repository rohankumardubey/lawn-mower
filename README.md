## The Goals of This Project

- Learning Golang and new tools like Kubernetes, ArgoCD, Prometheus and others.
- Microservices based on `Domain Driven Design (DDD)` implementation.
- Communication internally between our microservices with `gRPC` synchronously.
- Implementing various types of testing like `Unit Testing`, `Integration Testing` and `End To End Testing`.
- Using `Health Check` for reporting the health of app infrastructure components.
- Using Docker-Compose and Kubernetes for our deployment mechanism.
